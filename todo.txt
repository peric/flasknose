# Some Issues
  This is a very simple example that works fine on a localhost, but there are some BIG issues that need to be resolved before this code is opened up to the web.

  The user input isn’t sanitized
  Only one user can be using this web app at a time
  More care needs to be taken with read/write access
  More care needs to be taken with the relative file paths
  Speed?
  … and I’m sure I’m missing many more
  The bottom line is that with less than 20 lines of code we are able to generate R graphics in a browser… everything else is just details.
